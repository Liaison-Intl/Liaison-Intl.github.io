## Getting started

This site uses GitHub Pages.  GitHub Pages uses a static site generator called Jekyll.

To install Jekyll:

  * Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) by whatever method you prefer.  See `.ruby-version` to determine the correct version to use.
  * Install gems by running `gem install bundler && bundle` in this directory.

After installing, you can run Jekyll as follows:

    jekyll serve

And then visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).
