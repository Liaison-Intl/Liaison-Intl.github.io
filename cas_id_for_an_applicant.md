## CAS ID for an Applicant

The Liaison identifier for an applicant.

Some API calls, such as those that include the path `applicants_by_cas_id`, use the CAS ID for an applicant.  This identifier is used across Liaison systems to uniquely identify an applicant.  Think of it as having similar properties to a social security number (SSN) or a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).  Note however, that the CAS ID for an applicant is **NOT** a SSN or UUID.
