## API Overview

The basics of using WebAdMIT APIs.

All of our APIs are designed to allow permissioned users to look up, modify, or run tasks in from a direct back-end API.  This allows technically-savvy users of WebAdMIT to automate the retrieval of data from WebAdMIT for integration into other on-campus systems.

The following key points and conventions are followed:

  * This is a REST-based API that will be accessed over a standard HTTP/HTTPS API client library such as `Net::HTTP` or Apache `HttpClient` (all requests must use HTTPS).
  * Access is controlled via a the "API Access" permission granted in WebAdMIT, and a secure (and refreshable) API key is generated by the user in their account profile in WebAdMIT.
  * API Access permission is based off of WebAdMIT [user identities](user_identity.html). All of a user's exports, programs, etc. that can be accessed via API are owned by one of that user's identities.
  * The user's API key must be passed for every API request, and will be passed in the HTTP header of the request using the `x-api-key` header.
  * All API requests will be `GET` or `POST` actions against RESTful paths.
  * Response bodies from API calls will be JSON objects and arrays. The root for all API calls should be [https://api.webadmit.org](https://api.webadmit.org).

  <strong>Please note:</strong> Fields and endpoints may be added to responses without notice at any time.
  Additionally, a 500-level HTTP response indicating a server error may be given at any time.

### WebAdMIT Identities

All permissions in WebAdMIT cascade from the concept of [Identities](user_identity.html). What is an Identity in WebAdMIT? Each of the selectable items in the standard WebAdMIT account dropdown are considered to be standard admissions-level "identities" -- for most universities, this ties to the cohorts of students from each major graduate department.

There are two additional "special" types of identities available in WebAdMIT:

  * An "Association User" can access data for all schools in a given Centralized Application Service (e.g. someone at ASPPH would be able to access all data for all schools of public health in SOPHAS, and someone at AACP would be able to access data for all schools of pharmacy in PharmCAS)
  * An "Institution User" can access data for all departments & programs at a university implementing UniCAS (this type of user would be able to create a university-wide data export)

In general, configuration entities such as Lists, Exports, Email Templates, and so on in WebAdMIT are "owned" by one of a user's identities. Every identity that is part of a user's profile has a name and a unique identifier.  These can be retrieved via one of the API calls discussed in this documentation. Admissions, Association, and Institutional identities can all be addressed by name or ID in the same manner.

### WebAdMIT API Permissions & Keys

WebAdMIT user accounts who need access to the Export Manager API need to be given the "API Access" permission for each of the identities that they have in the WebAdMIT system and that they wish to access via the API. This permission can also be made part of a standard WebAdMIT Work Group.

Users with API Access enabled on at least one of their WebAdMIT identities will be able to generate an API key in their Edit My Account section of WebAdMIT. This API key will then be associated with that user and **all** of their identities within WebAdMIT. If the key is compromised, it can be regenerated from this screen at any time. This API key must be passed in the HTTP header (key name of `x-api-key`) of all requests to the API, or requests will be rejected.

### API Rate Limit

WebAdMIT will allow an individual API Key to access the API up to 1,000 times in a 1-hour period. This should be more than sufficient for all normal access. Users can view the current API Rate Limit as well as how many calls an individual API Key has left in the current 1-hour period by viewing the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` response headers of any API call.
