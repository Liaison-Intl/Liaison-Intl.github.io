## API Overview

The basics of using WebAdMIT APIs.

All of our APIs are designed to allow permissioned users to look up, modify, or run tasks from a direct back-end API.  This allows technically-savvy users of WebAdMIT to automate the retrieval of data from WebAdMIT for integration into other on-campus systems.

The following key points and conventions are followed:

  * This is a REST-based API that will be accessed over a standard HTTP/HTTPS API client library such as `Net::HTTP` or Apache `HttpClient` (all requests must use HTTPS).
  * Access is controlled via the "API Access" permission granted in WebAdMIT, and a secure (and refreshable) API key is generated by the user in their account profile in WebAdMIT.
  * API Access permission is based off of WebAdMIT [user identities](user_identity.html). All of a user's exports, programs, etc. that can be accessed via API are owned by one of that user's identities.
  * The user's API key must be passed for every API request, and will be passed in the HTTP header of the request using the `x-api-key` header.
  * All API requests will be `GET` or `POST` actions against RESTful paths.
  * Response bodies from API calls will be JSON objects and arrays. The root for all API calls should be [https://api.webadmit.org](https://api.webadmit.org).
