## API Overview

The basics of using WebAdMIT APIs.

All of our APIs are designed to allow permissioned users to look up, modify, or run tasks from a direct back-end API.  This allows technically-savvy users of WebAdMIT to automate the retrieval of data from WebAdMIT for integration into other on-campus systems.

The following key points and conventions are followed:

  * This is a REST-based API that will be accessed over a standard HTTP/HTTPS API client library such as `Net::HTTP` or Apache `HttpClient` (all requests must use HTTPS).
  * Access is controlled by [user identities, permissions, and API keys](webadmit_api_permissions_and_keys.html).
  * The user's API key must be passed for every API request, and will be passed in the HTTP header of the request using the `x-api-key` header.
  * Our API [rate limit](api_rate_limit.html) defines the maximum number of calls that can be made in a specified time period
  * All API requests will be `GET` or `POST` actions against RESTful paths.
  * Response bodies from API calls will be JSON objects and arrays. The root for all API calls should be [https://api.webadmit.org](https://api.webadmit.org).
